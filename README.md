# NixOS Configuration Template

## What is this?

I've been using NixOS for a while now and have helped a few of my friends to get started with it as well.
Every time I've done that, I ended up taking [my own NixOS configuration](https://github.com/paulmiro/nixos) and removing everything I didn't consider essential to create a starting point for my friend.

This process can be rather tedious though, which is why I decided to create this template repository.

This repository contains quite a bit of opinionanted configuration, but I tried my best to keep it clean and keep unexpected behaviour to a minimum.

## How to use

1. click "Use this template > Create a new repository" above
2. find every instance of "TODO" in this repository and follow the comment's instructions
3. download and use the [Graphical Installer](https://nixos.org/download/#nixos-iso) (even on machines that won't use a desktop environment later)
   - make sure to choose in the same username as you did in step 2
   - make sure your boot partition is big enough to hold a few kernels (512MB should be enough, but more won't hurt you if you have space to spare)
4. clone your flake to your new machine: `nix-shell -p gitMinimal --run "git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git" && cd YOUR-REPO-NAME`
5. copy your machine configuration to the repository: `install -D -m 644 /etc/nixos/* -t machines/YOUR-MACHINE-HOSTNAME`
   - make sure to add the new files to the git index: `nix-shell -p gitMinimal --run "git add ."` (flakes use the git index to list files, forgetting do add files is a common pitfall)
6. edit your `configuration.nix` file: (see the example configuration)
   - add the line `{ self, ... }:` above the first line
   - add the line `my-config.common.enable = true;` somewhere in the main body of the file
     - you can also use `comon-desktop` instead of `common` if you want to use the GNOME dekstop environment
7. run `nixos-rebuild switch --sudo --flake ".#YOUR-MACHINE-HOSTNAME"` to
   - (TODO: make sure no experimental features junk is needed here)
8. if everything worked, you can `sudo reboot now`
   - technically, this isn't neccessary, but it makes sure you get dropped into the proper shell/desktop environment
9. run `nix-channel --list` and then `nix-channel --remove NAME` for each listed channel
   - also do this again with sudo, to remove channels for the root user
10. Your machine is now ready to use ðŸŽ‰

### Other Peoples' NixOS Repositories

One of the great things about NixOS is the ability to steal other peoples modules to get the same functionality for yourself!

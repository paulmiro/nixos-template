    # A collection of NixOS modules covering hardware quirks.
    # https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware
    nixos-hardware.url = "github:NixOS/nixos-hardware/master";

    # Manage a user environment using Nix
    # https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager

    ### You may want to add inputs here if you want to use packages or modules from outside nixpkgs.
    ### Unless the README of the imported flake tells you not to do this, it's probably a good idea
    ###   to add `<input name>.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";`, just like with home-manager above.
    ### Doing so can greatly reduce the time and storage space taken by each rebuild.
